  <CENTER><h4>WHAT IS PADCATCH?</h4></CENTER>
  <CENTER><h5>Created by high school students, PadCatch is a game that draws attention to underprivileged females</h5></CENTER>
  <CENTER><h5>who can't afford or don't have access to feminine hygiene products. </h5><CENTER>
  <CENTER><h5>Based on the game's user activity, our sponsors will help us donate pads and tampons to women in homeless shelters and prisons. </h5><CENTER>
  <CENTER><h5>Because feminine hygiene products shouldn't be a "luxury". Period.</h5><CENTER>
  <CENTER><h4>WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT</h4><CENTER>
  <CENTER><h5>The period is a natural process that women go through each month, and we believe that having access to hygienic products is a necessity.<br> Underprivileged women shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable each month because of a natural bodily function.</h5><CENTER>

<!--PadCatch is an organization that hopes to help women get feminine hygiene products that they need. We will start donating in New York City and work to expand globally in the future. Based on the game's user activity, our sponsors will help us donate pads and tampons to women in homeless shelters and prisons. -->
